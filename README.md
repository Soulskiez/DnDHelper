# DnDHelper
Simple App that can give you data on dnd. Very helpful for dms who dont want to search through a monster book or spells.

Goal of this project is to demonstrate skill and knowledge with React.js. 

## The way that I am scoping work is giving each a simple projection.
* Very Small - Less then half a day
* Small - Half to full day
* Medium - 2 / 3 days
* Large - 1 week
* Very Large - Needs to be broken down into smaller tasks. More or less ideas I have not scoped yet.
